# Coursera-ML
This reposotiry represent the exercies or the mini-project from Coursera Machine Learning Course with Professeur Andrew. 
It was made by the language Octave at it contains multiple implimentation of machine learning algorithm.

ex1: It contains the implimentation of the algortihm of linear regression with Octave, it plot some data to show help us to make decision and pre-processing our data.
Also the different method of regularization and predication. 

Ex2: It contains the implimentation of the algorithm logistic regression, also with the plot data and the regulirization. the work was completley vectorized.

Ex3: It contains the implimentation of the algorithm of logistic regression, with multiple classes and also some principale of the nueral networks.
